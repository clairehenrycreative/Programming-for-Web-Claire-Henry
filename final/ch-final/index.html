	<p>Throughout our class, there have been many aspects of javascript I’ve found interesting but have been the most interested in generative art. I particularly enjoyed our 11.A assignment and would have loved to explore additional themes other than the one I chose. I thought a good way to explore this further would be to create distinctive generative art for each theme but make them share a similar visual attribute to show cohesion. The visual attribute I chose to utalize for this project was color. There’s a lot of variety otherwise in terms of canvas size, speed, and shape but they share the same color palette throughout.  </p>
